- Find all entries corresponding to submodules in the index :
git ls-files --stage | grep 160000

(if not in .gitmodules, were not correctly added as submodule: e.g. just repos within the main repo. Q : why sometimes took that into account, others not (cf Memoire) : name ?)

- Remove these bad entries from the index and readd as a submodule :
git rm --cached $PATH
(reclone if needed)
git submodule add $URL $PATH

(see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4161022/how-to-track-untracked-content/4162672#4162672 : subtree ?)

- compare with actual repos in the dir -> find . | grep -F ".git" | grep -v -F ".gitignore" | grep -v -F ".git/"
